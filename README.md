# vue-a11y-autocomplete-v2

[Live site](http://vue-autocomplete.surge.sh/)

This is an accessible country autocomplete built with the Vue js framework. I tried to follow [Adam Silver's article on building an accessible autocomplete](https://adamsilver.io/blog/building-an-accessible-autocomplete-control/) as I built this example. I also included Typescript.

There are unit tests with Jest and Vue Test Utils and Cypress for end to end tests. Vue Test Utils and Cypress are recommended by the Vue core team. Cypress also automatically checks accessibility with the cypress-axe plugin.
